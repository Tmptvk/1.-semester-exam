        This project was our first. We were randomly split into groups in our class <br>
        and was then given one out of 2 website. My group got the website “http://www.fyensrideklub.dk/” <br>
        The project was about redesigning the website, which we had been given. This means <br>
        we had to discover what problems the website has, and then figure out a way to solve them. <br>
        The first thing we did in our group, was fill out a NUG test, to see what each of us  <br>
        thought of the website, and how bad or good some of the things were. <br>
        After we had done that, we all agreed to start doing as much research as possible. <br>
        We researched what riding actually was, who used those clubs and what it meant to them. <br>
        We wanted to get a deeper understanding of the kind of people who we had to design this website to. <br>
        When we first started our redesign, we started of by making a logo for the website. <br>
        This was because there was no visible logo anywhere on the page, and we felt like it <br>
        would be a good idea to have, so users can more easily identity the page. See the logo here <br>
        <br>

        <img class="udklip" src="Images/projekt1.PNG" alt="Logo of the page">

        <br>
        After the logo was done, we then started designing the actual home page. We settled for some <br>
        colors and what information was actually important enough to show as the landing page. <br>
        All of the redesigning was done in the program <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/8174b2ce-3407-49c7-5bda-95d2b5843bd6-f745/?fbclid=IwAR1FmUOy8NoBIaltsMF7ifi8mzHxkv9BEaRLiAkgDGBxnwwpxvfE3oTStYU&fullscreen1"> "Adobe XD"
