        This project was our 2nd big assignment, and it was done in collaboration with the <br>
        H.C. Andersen museum. The assignment was to make an interactive installation for the museum. <br>
        It had to be enticing and have some kind of replay ability, to keep customers interested and <br>
        make them want more It had to be an installation that everyone would find enjoyable, as the <br>
        museum has people coming from all ages and backgrounds. In this project, we were <br>
        allowed to pick our own groups, which made it more enjoyable to work on. <br>
        <br>
        To begin with, our group came up with a bunch of different ideas, to get as much on the <br>
        table as possible. Slowly we then started to narrow our choices down, until we were <br>
        left with 1. Our idea was to make a “chose your own adventure” style of installation. <br>
        <br>
        In the project, we also made a couple of posters, to back up our presentation of the final product <br>
        one of which you can see here below <br>

        <br>
        The concept was to go on an adventure, as H.C. Andersen trough Europe as he did, just <br>
        with more choices to make it have replay value. All of our destinations and choices came <br>
        from a book written by H.C. Andersen himself, so everything you can do is realistic. <br>
        The idea is to get into a train coupe, and then have a screen in the middle of the room <br>
        with a bench on either side.
