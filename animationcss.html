        This assignment was a workshop in Animation with CSS. We were all asked to make an animation using CSS <br>
        with a minimum of 12 frames. We could choose one of the follow to animate – A logo, a portrait or a mascot. <br>
        I decided to go with a mascot, as I came up with an idea pretty fast. I wanted to animate a dog sitting down<br>
        whacking it’s tail. I started of by doing a quick sketch of how I wanted my dog to look, so I knew what I wanted <br>
        when I made it digitally. To make the animation, I used Illustrator and made a sprite sheet. The dog itself is <br>
        made fully of anchor points and vectors, so it’s scalable no matter what size would be needed. The different <br>
        parts of the dog itself, was made in different layers to make it easier to move certain limbs in the frames. <br>
        <br>
        After the sprites were made, I then needed to actually animate the figure. A limit was then found to the <br>
        animation I wanted to make. I originally wanted to make 60 frames in total, but ended up having to settle <br>
        for 42. Illustrator has a limit to how wide a spreadsheet can be, which limited me to 40 frames of 400x400 pixels. <br>
        The only way to get around this problem, would be to learn Javascript. With an approaching deadline, I had <br>
        to settle for 42 frames in total. In the code itself, I decided to make it repeat itself an infinite number of <br>
        times, to make the animation more smooth.
