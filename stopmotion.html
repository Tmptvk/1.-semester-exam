        As the intro project on the Multimediadesign education, everyone on the 1st semester was asked to make a stop motion movie. <br>
        The day before the project began, we had all been given 2 sticky notes, one green and one purple. On one of them, we were asked <br>
        to write something we wished to do in our life, and on the other one we wrote about something we disliked. When the project began <br>
        we were put into randomly decided groups, and had to pick one project leader. The project leader then had to go and pick 2 random <br>
        sticky notes, from all of the ones written the day before. Whatever was written on these sticky notes, was then our subject for the <br>
        stop motion movie. In our group, we ended up with the subjects “I want to be remembered for something” and “I hate to regret” <br> <br>
        If you don’t know what a stop motion movie is, then think of it as a series of pictures that moves fast to give the illusion of movement. <br>
        A couple of examples of well known stop motion movies could be “Wallace and Gromit” or the newer “Kubo and the Two Strings”
