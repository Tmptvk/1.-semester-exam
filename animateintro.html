        The first time we were introduced to animate, we were asked to make a simple animation of a car driving. <br>
        I had never tried the program before but was very excited to see what it could offer. I quickly learned <br>
        that using this program, would perhaps not be as easy as I thought. We started the assignment in class <br>
        so we had time to ask our teacher as well as our fellow students for help. At home we were then supposed <br>
        to finish our animation, and upload it so everyone could see it. Before we started animating the car <br>
        driving, we were asked to make a storyboard, to sketch out our idea. Both the storyboard and the <br>
        animation itself can be seen below.
