        As the first big assignment involving the Adobe programs, we were asked to make a “Movingart” animation. <br>
        Movingart is a style of animation, often involving a classic painted, and then adding life to it via animation. <br>
        To start of with, we had to pick a painting to work with. I decided to pick “Banksy, Girl with Balloon” as my <br>
        paining, as I had already developed an idea for it. The original painting shows a little girl, who has just lost <br>
        her balloon. The way I decided to give life to this paining, was to make the balloon fly away from her and out <br>
        of the screen. In the workshop we used the program “animate” and to fully develop my animation I used two <br>
        tools namely the classic tween and the motion tween.
        <br> <br>
        Before the workshop began, I researched the 12 principles of animation (The illusion of life, the 12 principles) <br>
        My animation follows the principle "Secondary action" <br>
        Secondary is when a secondary object or person, supports the main action in the animation <br>
        In this case, the balloon which is flying away from the girl, has a string attached to it <br>
        which waves in the wind, supporting the illusion of movement of the balloon
